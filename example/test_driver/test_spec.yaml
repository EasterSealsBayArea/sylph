phases:
  # The install phase includes commands that install dependencies that your tests use.
  # Default dependencies for testing frameworks supported on Device Farm are already installed.
  install:
    commands:
      # By default, Appium server version used is 1.7.2.
      # You can switch to an alternate supported version from 1.6.5, 1.7.1, 1.7.2, 1.8.0 or 1.8.1 by using a command like "avm 1.7.1"
      # OR
      # To install a newer version of Appium use the following commands:
      # - export APPIUM_VERSION=1.8.1
      # - avm $APPIUM_VERSION
